## Reflection

This project was developed as a side project for the Jump Academy Bootcamp to understand and implement React class components and lifecycle methods.

The goal was to build a user-friendly application where users can easily generate, like, filter, and sort quotes from "The Simpsons."

The project posed a series of challenges including:

- Understanding and implementing React class components and lifecycle methods
- Performing API calls
- Implementing prop drilling
- Working with multiple components

These challenges were significant in deepening my understanding of React and how different parts of an application interact with each other.

### Tools Used

React
Visual Studio Code
Node

For this project, Create React App was chosen to scaffold the application. It provided a comfortable and automated environment, taking care of configuration and allowing the focus to be on writing the React code itself.
